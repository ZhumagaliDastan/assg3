Sure, here's an example README file for the project:

# Assignment 3

This is a Java project for Assignment 3 of the COMPSCI 101 course. It consists of three classes: MyStack, MyQueue, and Main.

## MyStack

MyStack is a generic class that implements a stack using a LinkedList. It contains the following methods:

- `push(E element)` adds an element to the top of the stack
- `peek()` returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it
- `isEmpty()` returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise
- `size()` returns the number of elements in the stack
- `pop()` removes and returns the element at the top of the stack

## MyQueue

MyQueue is a generic class that implements a queue using a LinkedList. It contains the following methods:

- `enqueue(E element)` adds an element to the end of the queue
- `dequeue()` removes and returns the first element in the queue
- `isEmpty()` returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise
- `size()` returns the number of elements in the queue
- `peek()` returns the first element in the queue without removing it

## Main

Main is a class that contains a main method for testing MyStack and MyQueue. It creates a MyStack and a MyQueue object, adds elements to them, and performs various operations.

## Getting started

To run the project, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/

Once you have Java installed, you can compile and run the Main class using the following commands:

```
javac Main.java
java Main
```
